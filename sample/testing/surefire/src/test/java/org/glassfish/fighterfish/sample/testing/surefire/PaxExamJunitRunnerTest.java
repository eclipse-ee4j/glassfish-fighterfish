/**
 * This test sample demonstrates use of pax-exam provided {@link JUnit4TestRunner} JUnit test runner. This test class
 * name is suffixed with Test to automatically include it in the test list by maven surefire plugin.
 *
 * This custom runner from PAX-EXAM has the ability to provision an OSGi runtime either in the current JVM or in a
 * remote JVM with a list of bundles configured by the test. The custom runner calls a method in the test class
 * annotated with {@link Configuration} and uses its return value to configure the environment. In our test case,
 * {@link #getPaxExamConfiguration()} is that method.
 *
 * This test case also demonstrates use {@link TestContext} to deploy various artifacts like OSGi bundles, Java EE
 * applications, JDBC/JMS resources. See {@link #test}.
