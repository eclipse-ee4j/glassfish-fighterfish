# This is a simple bnd instructions file that we use to run OSGi Compliance Tests.
# We use the same file for all test suites, viz: 
# org.osgi.test.cases.http, 
# org.osgi.test.cases.transaction, 
# org.osgi.test.cases.webcontainer, 
# org.osgi.test.cases.jdbc, 
# etc.
#
# This script uses following properties which are supplied to it from command line via -D properties:
#
# glassfish.home -  specifies where glassfish has been installed.
# ct.home - specifies where OSGi CT has been checked out
# ct.name - refers to the OSGi CT test suite that we want to run. e.g., http|transaction|webcontainer

# Ideally running glassfish.jar should be sufficient, but the CT assumes certain environment.
# So, we provision some additional bundles.
# javax.servlet-api_2.5 is needed for OSGi r4v42 HTTP CT as it expects javax.servlet 2.5 package.
# Although javax.servlet 3.0 is backward compatible, it can't wire to it.
# Similarly, org.osgi.impl.service.log-1.3.2.jar is needed for OSGi Web CT as GlassFish does not have a log service bundle
# and the CT requires a LogService to test certain scenarios. 
# test.ct.misc.bundle.delay.jar is needed for all CTs, because the CTs assume everything is immediately started,
# where as GlassFish starts all the OSGi services after its core services are started. So, this delay bundle
# introduces a 10 second delay so that CTs don't start running before services are available.
